These are some basic email newsletter layouts created for use in Marketo (so you may notice a few Marketo relics).

To make these, I started with Litmus' Slate newsletter template and reworked it. I kept the 500px width and client-specific styling patterns, which I found to be very good when I tested these in 40+ email clients via Litmus.
